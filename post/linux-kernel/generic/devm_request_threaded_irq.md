# concept of devm_request_threaded_irq()

The implementation of devm_request_threaded_irq() in the Linux kernel is quite complex, and it involves multiple kernel subsystems, including the interrupt subsystem, the softirq subsystem, and the threading subsystem. However, I can give you a brief overview of how the threaded softirq mechanism is used to implement devm_request_threaded_irq().

When a driver calls devm_request_threaded_irq() to request a threaded IRQ, the Linux kernel performs the following steps:

The kernel registers an interrupt handler function using request_irq(). This function will be executed when the interrupt is triggered.

The kernel allocates a new kernel thread using kthread_create(). This thread will be used to execute the threaded IRQ handler function in a separate kernel thread.

The kernel registers a threaded softirq using tasklet_init() or irq_thread_create(). This softirq will be used to schedule the threaded IRQ handler function in the new kernel thread.

When the interrupt is triggered, the interrupt handler function is executed in interrupt context.

The interrupt handler function schedules the threaded softirq using tasklet_schedule() or irq_thread_queue_handler(). This schedules the threaded IRQ handler function to be executed in the new kernel thread.

The threaded IRQ handler function is executed in the new kernel thread. This function can perform any necessary processing or handling of the interrupt.

When the threaded IRQ handler function completes, the kernel thread is terminated using kthread_stop().

Here is a simplified code example that shows how the threaded softirq mechanism can be used to implement a basic threaded interrupt handler function:

```C
#include <linux/interrupt.h>
#include <linux/kthread.h>

irqreturn_t my_interrupt_handler(int irq, void *dev_id)
{
    struct task_struct *task;
    int ret;

    /* allocate a new kernel thread */
    task = kthread_create(my_thread_fn, NULL, "my_thread");

    /* register a threaded softirq */
    tasklet_init(&my_threaded_softirq, my_threaded_irq_handler, 0);

    /* schedule the threaded softirq */
    ret = tasklet_schedule(&my_threaded_softirq);
    if (ret)
        kthread_stop(task);

    return IRQ_HANDLED;
}

int my_thread_fn(void *data)
{
    /* handle the threaded interrupt in the kernel thread */
    return 0;
}

void my_threaded_irq_handler(unsigned long data)
{
    /* execute the threaded interrupt handler function */
}
```
This code example is simplified for illustration purposes only, and it does not include error handling or other important details that would be required in a real-world implementation. However, it should give you an idea of how the threaded softirq mechanism can be used to implement a basic threaded interrupt handler function in the Linux kernel.
